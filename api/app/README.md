# This is a character creator app made with react, redux, and a rails API. 

I'm an artist! So I often need to use different characters/stories for animation. This app helps with that! 

The user will be able to create a random character with a name, location, image, date, and background information for infinite art project or story ideas! The user will also be able to like characters.

There will be an about page for additional character creation info, including information about https://generated.photos/, which will help with character ideas when you don't know what kind of character to put into your project! (There is also a separate react rails api to just get random character images if that's all you need!): https://github.com/DahliaBloomstone/Character-creator
(This implements an API key from generates.photos)

Start creating characters now!
